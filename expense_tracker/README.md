# Project title:
Expense Tracker App

# Description:
This web app is designed to be used to track monthly expenses.

# Technologies used:
Vanilla HMTL, CSS, & JavaScript

# Features:
Full CRUD operations, i.e. the user can add expense items to the tracker, view them, edit them, and delete them.
A transaction history table tracks each transaction added.
A total income/expenses/balance is displayed in the bottom right of the page.

# Installation Instructions:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have a 'live local server' extension for your text editor/IDE.

# Usage:
- To add a transaction, enter a description, an amount, and select a category for the transaction.
- Then, click 'Add Transaction' / the 'Transaction History' table will now be updated with the item details.
- This transaction can be edited, by clicking the 'edit' button, or deleted by clicking the 'delete' button.
- The entire transaction table can be deleted by clicking 'Clear All'.

- A 'Dark Mode' button enables/disables dark mode.

## Notes - my first web app:

# Writing the Javascript:
Using the Document Object Model to write JavaScript was very unusual for me, as this was my first web app.
I looked up some tutorials regarding how to write Javascript for web apps, and used JS to play around with the HTML elements until I fully understood how everything fit together.
After completing my initial designs (and with a few teething issues involving Event Listeners), I was more or less done.

# Making adjustments:
After completing my app and taking a look at it, I was generally unimpressed. I decided to make a list of things that I would like to change, starting with some design choices - these are detailed in the issues-features.md file located in the same directory.

# Final words:
There are probably many more things I could do to improve this app, however everything needs an end, and this app is no exception.
The app I have created is suitable for my purposes, and I have already used it on a few occasions.
