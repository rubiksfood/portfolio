Selection of projects to showcase my programming abilities

# Expense Tracker
This web app was inspired by a tutorial found online, however I opted for a more streamlined design and changed much of the functionality.

# Shopping List
This is my first proper web app to use the MERN stack. 
Inspired by a, now defunct, shopping list app called 'Hngry'.
I used that app regularly, so I wanted to produce something that could replace it.

# Playback Speed Calculator
This was my first entirely orignal app idea.
Inspired by watching YouTube videos at various speeds in lunch breaks.
I realised that calculating the resulting video length by altering the speeds was not particularly intuitive, so I developed this calculator to solve the problem.
