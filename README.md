Selection of projects to showcase my programming abilities

# Expense Tracker
This was my first web app, inspired by various tutorials found online.
However, I came up with an original design and added whatever functionality I thought would improve the UX.

# Knit Converter
This is an original idea, inspired by a lover of knitting (my mother).
She wanted to knit a new pattern, however it contained US English knitting terminlogy, which she found confusing.
As a result, I created a python script which takes a PDF, converts the US English knitting terms to UK English, and outputs a new PDF with the changes.

# Playback Speed Calculator
This was my first original web app idea.
Inspired by watching YouTube videos at various speeds in study breaks.
I realised that calculating the resulting video length by altering the speeds was not particularly intuitive, so I developed this calculator to solve the problem.

# Shopping List
This is my first web app to use the MERN stack. 
Inspired by a, now defunct, shopping list app called 'Hngry'.
I used that app regularly, so I wanted to produce something that could replace it.
