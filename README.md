A full-stack MERN application built with a **QA-first mindset**, focusing on test strategy, automation, and system reliability.  
This project demonstrates my ability to design **testable systems**, apply the **test pyramid effectively**, and validate real user behaviour through backend, frontend, and end-to-end (E2E) testing.

> **Primary focus:** QA / Test Automation / SDET roles  

## 🧭 QA Focus & Skills Demonstrated

- Designing systems with **testability as a first-class concern**
- Applying the **test pyramid** across unit, integration, and E2E layers
- API, frontend, and E2E automation
- Writing **security-focused tests** (authentication, access control, data isolation)
- CI-driven regression detection with actionable failure evidence
- Risk-based test selection to maximise confidence while minimising flakiness
- Failure analysis using logs, traces, screenshots, and reports

📄 Detailed testing strategy and rationale: [`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](./TESTING_STRATEGY.md)

## 🚀 Overview
This app allows users to create and manage personalised shopping lists with full authentication, CRUD functionality, and persistent data storage in MongoDB. The UX is designed to be fast and intuitive for real-world shopping scenarios.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Vite), TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) + protected API routes
- **Misc**: React Router, custom hook, modular components
- **Testing & QA**: Jest, Supertest, Vitest, React Testing Library, MSW, Playwright

## ✨ Key Behaviours & Features

### 🔐 Secure Authentication
- Registration & login with hashed passwords
- JWT-based sessions stored client-side
- Protected API routes and protected frontend pages
- Automatic redirect for unauthenticated users

### 📝 Shopping List Management
- Create, read, update, and delete items
- “Cross off” items with a toggle switch
- “Uncross” items to return them to the active list
- Smart UI grouping: active items at the top, checked items grouped below
- Modal-driven add/edit form for a clean and efficient workflow
- Responsive layout optimised for desktop and mobile

### 🧱 Architecture & Testability Highlights
- Clean separation of concerns to support **independent test layers**
- Backend designed for **API-level integration testing** (Jest + Supertest)
- Frontend structured for **component, integration, and state-based testing** (Vitest + RTL + MSW)
- E2E testing with Playwright validating full system behaviour across UI, API, and database
- Dedicated test databases and strict data isolation for reliable automation

**Potential future QA enhancements**:
- Token expiry and session invalidation testing
- Accessibility smoke checks (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
- Cross-browser E2E execution in CI

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Testing is treated as a **first-class concern** in this project, with clear separation between unit, integration, system, and end-to-end test levels in line with the test pyramid.  

This project includes comprehensive automated testing on the frontend, backend, and E2E, designed using ISTQB-aligned principles and real-world best practices. 
Testing focuses on functional correctness, error handling, security-related behaviour, and regression protection.  

Test cases are designed using equivalence partitioning, state transitions, and negative-path analysis where appropriate. 
While the focus is on automation, test scenarios are derived from exploratory and risk-based analysis before being automated.  

### Example Defects This Test Suite Is Designed to Catch

- Users accessing protected routes after token invalidation
- Cross-user data leakage due to missing ownership checks
- UI state desynchronisation after failed API mutations
- Silent backend failures masked by optimistic UI updates

### 🔹 Backend Testing (Node.js / Express)

Backend testing verifies API correctness, security, and data isolation using Jest and Supertest, backed by a dedicated MongoDB test database.

Key aspects include:

- Integration testing of REST API routes:
  - Authentication (/auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/me)
  - CRUD operations for shopping items (/shopItem)
- JWT authentication & authorization testing, including middleware behaviour
- Security-related functional testing:
  - Access control
  - Per-user data isolation
  - Protection against cross-user access
- Negative and error-handling tests for:
  - Missing or invalid inputs
  - Invalid ObjectIds
  - Missing or malformed Authorization headers
- Tests use realistic request/response flows to validate full backend behaviour

Backend tests ensure that users can only access their own data, that invalid requests fail safely, and that API changes are protected by an automated regression suite.

Run backend tests:  
```
cd server
npm test
```

### 🔹 Frontend Testing (React)

Frontend testing validates UI behaviour, state transitions, routing, and API interactions using Vitest, React Testing Library, and Mock Service Worker (MSW).

Key aspects include:
- Component & integration testing of pages and UI components (Login, Register, Navbar, ShoppingList, forms)
- Authentication flow testing (login, logout, protected routes, redirects)
- State-based testing for auth state, loading states, and item toggling
- Custom hook testing (useShopItems) for data fetching, loading behaviour, error handling, and CRUD updates
- Mocked API interactions via MSW to simulate success, error, and unauthorised responses
- Behaviour-driven assertions focusing on what the user sees and can do, rather than internal implementation details

Frontend tests run in a JSDOM environment and provide fast, repeatable regression coverage for UI logic and routing.

Run frontend tests:  
```
cd client  
npm test  
```

### 🔹 End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Playwright)

The project includes a focused, high-value E2E test suite implemented with **Playwright**, designed to validate real user workflows across the **entire system**:

- React frontend
- Express backend
- MongoDB persistence
- Authentication and route protection
- Per-user data isolation

#### E2E Testing Goals
- Validate that all application layers integrate correctly
- Catch regressions that unit and integration tests cannot detect
- Confirm security-related behaviour from a user perspective
- Provide confidence that core flows work in real browser conditions

This E2E suite is intentionally **small, stable, and high-value**, reflecting real-world QA practice where E2E tests are used to protect critical user journeys rather than duplicate lower-level test coverage.

#### Covered User Journeys
- Unauthenticated access is redirected to login
- Login and logout flows
- Access to protected routes after authentication
- Creating and deleting shopping list items
- Data isolation between different users

#### Key Characteristics
- Real browser execution (Playwright-managed browsers)
- Dedicated E2E MongoDB test database
- Database reset before test execution
- Strict data isolation prevents cross-test contamination and mirrors real multi-user risk scenarios
- Automatic startup of backend, frontend, and database via scripts
- One-command execution


Run E2E tests locally:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

This command:
- Starts required Docker containers
- Launches backend and frontend services
- Resets the E2E database
- Executes the Playwright test suite

---

## ✅ Overall Testing Goals

Together, the backend, frontend, and E2E test suites:
- Validate correct behaviour under normal and error conditions
- Detect defects early, prevent regressions, and reduce risk before changes reach production
- Demonstrate structured, professional test design
- Reflect real-world QA expectations

This testing approach supports the project’s goal of showcasing not just functionality, but also engineering discipline and test-aware development.
