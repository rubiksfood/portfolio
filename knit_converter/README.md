# Features:

- Contains a dictionary object that can easily be expanded upon for further terminology.

# Installation Instructions:

# Usage:
- User must have 1 folder containing the desired PDFs of US knitting patterns and 1 folder for the converted PDFs.
- User must then configure the 'input_path' & 'output_path' variables of the script to your desired source & target directories.
- User runs the script in the terminal & the converted PDFs will appear in the directory given to 'output_path'.

# Notes:
This project is an original idea, created for my mother. 
She wanted to knit patterns from the US, but was confused by the terminology.
